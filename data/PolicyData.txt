As a result of this change, political parties will receive an annual amount of 500,000 ren per Member of Assembly. This adjustment leads to a doubling of the election budget for the party with the highest seat count (USP) and a slight increase for other parties in the Assembly. However, it also means that parties falling below the 10% election threshold will no longer receive any public funding.
