The new measure replaces the previous system, based on the number of votes won in the general election, with a system reliant on the proportion of seats secured by a political party in the Assembly.\n\nSection II sets the annual financial allocation to political parties at 500,000 Ren per each Member of Assembly. This shift ensures that financial support from public funds aligns more closely with a party's representative influence within the legislative body.\n\nSection III, a consequential effect of these amendments, will effectively lead to a substantial increase in the election budget for the USP and a minor augmentation for other parties present in the Assembly. This restructuring of funding fosters a more proportional representation of party presence within the Assembly.\n\nSection IV highlights an important consequence of this reallocation. Parties that do not meet the 10% election threshold will see their public funding effectively curtailed. This measure ensures that public resources are concentrated towards parties with a significant representation in the Assembly.",

This measure ensures consistency and unity in religious practices across the country.\n\nSection III of the R.H.B. sets forth new regulations for priests seeking state-sanctioned positions.

It unequivocally criminalizes such acts, strengthening the legal framework for the protection of women's rights.\n\nSubsection I.A of the W.L.A. establishes a system of state protection for victims of domestic abuse. This includes counseling, temporary shelter arrangements, and legal support, ensuring a comprehensive safety net for affected women.\n\nSection II of the W.L.A. addresses the issue of wage disparity. It mandates equal pay for women, and to support this transition, it provides subsidies to businesses to offset any resulting expenditure differences. Further, it mandates the adjustment of salaries for all female government personnel to ensure pay parity.\n\nSection III of the W.L.A. highlights the importance of education in fostering equality. It mandates that the education system must provide equal treatment to both genders, supporting an environment of fairness and mutual respect from an early age.\n\nSection IV of the W.L.A. makes significant strides towards supporting working mothers. It introduces state-paid maternity leave and establishes state-subsidized daycare centers, ensuring mothers receive the support they need to balance their professional and familial responsibilities. <b>[-2 Government Budget]</b>",

This act proposes an amendment to Section VI of the Tax Code of 1949.\n\nSection I of the F.L.T.A. determines a 15% tax rate on luxury goods, as categorized by the Ministry of Economy. The definition of luxury goods under this act includes, but is not limited to, jewelry, furs, sports cars, yachts, and private planes. The implementation of this tax is intended to ensure that those with the means to purchase such items contribute proportionally to the state's revenue.\n\nSection II of the F.L.T.A. establishes a 10% estate tax applicable in situations of purchase, sale, and property transfer, particularly in cases of inheritance. This measure seeks to promote fairness in the tax system, ensuring that significant wealth transfers contribute appropriately to the state's revenue, while also deterring large-scale wealth accumulation through inheritance. <b>[+2 Government Budget]</b>",

This broad-reaching measure extends to an array of public services, including buses, trams, trains, and ferries. The Act ensures that all Sordland citizens can access these services free of charge, promoting greater mobility, enhancing societal inclusivity, and reducing economic strain on those heavily reliant on public transport.\n\nSection II of the C.M.A. of '57 establishes an exemption for luxury first-class transportation options. Given the targeted audience and the elevated costs associated with these services, they will not fall under the subsidy umbrella of the Act. This exemption ensures a judicious use of state resources, focusing on providing broader societal benefits rather than subsidizing luxury experiences. <b>[-3 Government Budget]</b>",

This incentivises fair work practices and ensures employees are duly compensated for their extended efforts.\n\nSection IV focuses on worker safety and humane work conditions.

This promotes a culture of respect and care within workplaces across Sordland.\n\nSection V extends these protections to migrant or undocumented workers, granting them the same rights as Sordish citizens.

With these measures, Bergia can finally be an equal part of Sordland.\n\nSection III promotes the enforcement of standard national laws and policies across Bergia, dismantling the current semi-independent security structure.
